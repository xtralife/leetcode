Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note**:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Example 2
```
   4
  / \
 5   6
/ \   \
7  8   9

Pre: 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 9
In: 7, 5, 8, 4, 6, 9
```
